<p>Making Modern Taiwan: History, Politics, Society, and Culture</p>

<p>Fall 2020</p>

<p>Rev. July 13, 2020</p>

<p>Jackson School of International Studies</p>

<p>Professor James Lin</p>

<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>This graduate reading seminar is an interdisciplinary survey of Taiwan Studies. It aims to introduce graduate students to key themes that have defined Taiwanese history, politics, society, and culture. How has Taiwan been shaped by colonialism, geography, and peoples? How have these forces resulted in key issues today such as identity, democratisation, and cross-Strait relations? How has Taiwan imagined the world and its own place within it?</p>

<p>Each week we will discuss key issues in Taiwanese history, including migration, colonialism, ethnic identity, urban spaces, the Cold War, development, business, labor, and gender. Recent and classic monographs and articles from history, anthropology, economics, political science, sociology, cultural studies, and gender studies will serve as case studies and interpretive framework for major issues in contemporary and historical Taiwan.</p>

<p>By the end of the course students should be able to critically analyse historical events using lenses for both the local and the global to understand historical context and contingencies. Furthermore, s=this course will also seek to build professional skills used in academia and outside, and thus will provide assignments in critical responses, peer review, oral presentation, and research.</p>
